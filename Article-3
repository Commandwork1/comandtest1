<h1>Threats impacting forest health</h1>
 <h3>By <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/author/laura-olivieri">Laura Olivieri</a>   Aug. 20, 2015 , 2:15 PM</h3>   
 <p>Forests are vital. They help produce the oxygen we breathe and
sequester the carbon that is warming the planet. But what happens
when forest health starts to decline? This week’s <i> Science</i> special
issue on forest health explores that question, and examines threats
facing forests around the globe—both natural and human-caused.

<h1>1. Wildfire</h1>
<p>Fire is a natural part of forest ecosystems, and the boreal forests of
the far north are no stranger to flames. One widespread boreal tree,
the black spruce, owes its success to an adaption to fire. The
spruce’s seeds are locked away in cones that only open up when
they get singed. The seeds secure a new generation of spruce after
a wildfire has swept through a forest. But increasingly hot summers
are favoring more intense and frequent wildfires, a trend that
makes it harder for new spruce to sprout.
